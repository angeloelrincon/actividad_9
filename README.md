# Classroom Management System
In this project we`re going to create a XML file and its dtd, which stores information about a class: the teachers and the modules they teach, and the students and the modules they are taking.

## Getting Started
To view or manipulate the class information, you need to download both the XML and DTD files and open them with a code editor.
